## Research Interests

- Image Processing
- Deep Learning
- Applied Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Transfer Learning

My previous research focused on **Medical Image**  based on **Deep Learning**. I think it makes sense to make a system that assists doctors in making diagnoses, which can reduce the workload of doctors and reduce the waiting time of patients.I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
